# ADRC-Testbench
## Algorithm for 3D plot of system dynamics over a variable axis 
### Creating a third perpendicular axis with a for loop (extending the dimension of the plot), plotting over the change of a determined control system parameter. In this example, OTP is varied over time. 
This is using an special type of ADRC for first order system. Yet, the algoritm remains the same, using just diferent controller functions

Testbench_algorithm.mlx doesn't plot correctly it seems. Use .m file to get correct plots
